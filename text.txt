Summer is a time for vacations! Every year I spend summer with my family and friends.

I usually have a lot of free time in summer. I play football with my father and little sister. We often go to the countryside to swim and sunbathe. We make barbecue and sometimes sleep in the tent.

Summer evenings are warm and we often go to the park to have a small picnic. We play board games, listen to music and sing songs. Sometimes our friends come with us and we play volleyball or badminton. I like to take photos of my friends and family.
